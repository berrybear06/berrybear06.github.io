I'm an aspiring electrical/mechanical engineer and programmer. 
I love looking for technological and social issues that 
I can help solve with math and physics knowledge. 
Especially thanks to contest prep, I have no shortage of it.

This website is one of my projects, which you can check out on my [Projects page](/projects).
