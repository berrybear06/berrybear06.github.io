I'm an aspiring mechanical engineer and programmer. I've always enjoyed studying theoretical mathematics and physics, especially as preparation for contests. In the future, I hope to address technological and social issues with my knowledge.

This website is just one of my projects, which you can check out on my [Projects page](/projects).
