I worked with friends to build the first version of FitGPT at a hackathon.
We coded its image preprocessor, gathered training data, and created the model all in the 8-hour time window of the event.
FitGPT uses OpenCV and a PyTorch convolutional neural network to analyze pictures of you and recommend colors for you to wear, spicing up your style.
