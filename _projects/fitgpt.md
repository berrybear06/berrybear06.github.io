FitGPT is an AI model powered by OpenCV and PyTorch that 
analyzes pictures of people and recommends outfit colors. 
I worked with friends to make the first version of FitGPT at a hackathon. 
We coded its image preprocessor, gathered training data, and 
created the CNN architecture, barely getting it functional in our allotted eight hours.

Afterwards, I made the website using React, Tailwind CSS with daisyUI for styling, 
and jQuery for the demo functionality. 
(The demo is probably offline because 
I have been hosting the FitGPT model online with free credits.)
