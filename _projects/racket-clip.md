I engineered a solution to prevent my tennis racket from unzipping my backpack as I walk around. 
I 3D modeled the clip in Autodesk Fusion and went through many, many prototypes before 
printing the final version in Markforged Onyx filament. 
The original clip still works after **3 years**: 3 tennis seasons of continuous use! 

Seeing its success, I revisited the project and made another version 
tailored to my tennis teammates' equipment, 
as they suffered from the same unzipping problem.
