I engineered a solution to prevent my tennis racket from unzipping my backpack as I walk around.
I originally made my project a few years ago, 3D modeling it in Autodesk Fusion and printing it in Markforged Onyx filament.
Recently, I've revived it as I've been designing a new version tailored to my friend's equipment.
