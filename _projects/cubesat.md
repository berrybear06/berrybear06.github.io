I lead software development for my school's CubeSat team. 
I joined in the middle of our current mission: 
to analyze light pollution above North America. 
**We're launching December 2024!!**

My first focus was [radio communications](https://github.com/GISCubeSat/Communications/tree/new-protocol/CIRCUITPY), 
as I designed an error-resistant file transfer protocol, 
integrated it into [satellite flight software](https://github.com/GISCubeSat/Eng_Model), 
and programmed our ground station to receive images. 
I now handle a few more tasks as subsystem lead. 
I assemble and troubleshoot some hardware, especially for the ground station, 
and I patch bugs in the satellite software 
(ever since a bunch of members graduated, I've been the only one who can.)

I've also been writing development utilities to make life easier with our CircuitPython boards. 
Those include a script to toggle file system write permissions and 
a custom serial console with the ability to send and receive files. 
We're currently building a rotating mount for our directional radio antennas. 
They're taking their sweet time, though; 
I've had the viewing angle calculation and servo control code ready for a month.
