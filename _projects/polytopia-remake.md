I started recreating the Battle of Polytopia on Scratch at the beginning of 2023. 
I've coded some cool features without having to copy much from other people's projects. 
My game generates world maps from random seeds like Minecraft does, 
it implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate where you can move a unit, 
and it uses a system to record and replay moves made by you and other players 
(yes, there's multiplayer,) among other things.

Unfortunately, I'm limited by Scratch's simplicity (read: lack of features) and 
my previous self's insistence on making sprites into classes. 
I doubt whether I can finish the game by myself, 
but it might already be the best recreation on Scratch.
